<h2>Why Not?</h2>

<p>The general consensus of people with disabilities, the web design and development community, and legal voices in this space, are that accessibility overlays are not useful on a website for the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>They do not address inherent accessibility barriers. For example, missing alternative text, proper labeling, keyboard access, etc. A plugin cannot fix these things (at least not yet).</li>
  <li>While tools like this may be of some benefit to a small minority of people, we can assume that many people with disabilities already have the tools they require to navigate the web or can more easily leverage tools already built into their browsers and operating systems. Your website is not the first one they have visited.</li>
  <li>Turnkey solutions like this set a bad precedent by lulling stakeholders into a false sense of security about the true accessibility of their website. Many of these vendors take advantage of one’s lack of knowledge about accessibility and sell empty promises that will not shield a company from litigation regarding the inaccessibility of their website.</li>
  <li>Privacy. People with disabilities have more a stake in protecting their anonymity online and often want to avoid being singled out and/or treated differently, so there is distrust in using tools like these.</li>
</ol> 

<h2>So what do I do to make my website accessible?</h2>

<p>The answer is simple: People who are disabled want to be treated equally, so they expect you to design and build your website with inclusion and accessibility in mind and not throw a band-aid on it. The only way to do that is to commit, provision for it up front, and make accessibility a part of your process throughout the lifetime of your website.</p>
